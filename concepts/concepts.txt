1. You have successfully created a static webpage called "webpage.html"

2. The problem with static page is that:
    a) Someone needs to code it in HTML whenever he/she wants to add/delete an item
    b) It is a file based system and no links connect that page

3. Point 2.a will be solved using Python, as it will write an HTML code based on the data we give.

4. Point 2.b will be solved by creating a HTTP web server that will serve the file using a URL.
